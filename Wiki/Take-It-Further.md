## Scenario 1:

Customize the app to have a different name depending on the team it is installed in. 

For ex: IT aka Contoso IT Support.
 

**Suggested Solution:** Please follow below mentioned steps to configure the app to be used for different domains:

**Code Changes:**

- Change the text references in the associated resource(Strings.resx) file from FAQ Plus to the domain on which it should cater to.

- Update the app name, description, tab name and other details in the associated manifest JSON files for end-user and experts team respectively.

- Change the welcome message as desired in the configurator web app.

  
**Pros:** Very minimal changes required.

## Scenario 2:

Configure the bot to use an existing knowledge base with QnA pairs instead of a raw vanilla Question Answering knowledge base.

**Suggested Solution:**

1) Change the **Project Name** field value in the configurator app and your bot will start pointing to knowledge base with QnA pairs associated with updated Question Answering project knowledge base.
