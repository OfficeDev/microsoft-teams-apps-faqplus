Chatbots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by end-users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with end-users in a meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails. 

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the end-user to submit a query which then gets posted in a pre-configured team of experts to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within their team itself.

**The July 2020 (version 3) release of FAQ Plus includes a multi-turn feature to the end user experience. With the multi-turn feature, users will be presented with follow-up options along with an answer to their question. This enables the FAQ Plus bot to answer the user's question with more relevance. Multi-turn follow-up options are programmed directly into the QnA Maker when the tenant admin uploads the proper documents into the knowledge base.**

**Earlier releases of FAQ Plus has following features:**

*	An Enduser interacting with FAQ Plus:
