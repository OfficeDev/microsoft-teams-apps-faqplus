Chatbots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in a meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails.  

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the user to submit a query which then gets posted in a pre-configured team of experts who are help to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within their Team itself. 

**FAQ Plus has following features:**
